3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours

## Security Measures

This API implements several security measures:

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Secure password hashing using industry standards
- Session management with automatic expiration

### Rate Limiting
- Failed login attempt tracking and lockout
- Configurable lockout thresholds and durations
- IP-based rate limiting

### Data Protection
- Environment variable protection for sensitive data
- CORS configuration for controlled access
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

### Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS enforcement (recommended for production)
- Secure headers implementation
- Database connection encryption

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Environment Configuration
- Use strong, unique passwords for database connections
- Generate secure JWT secret keys (minimum 32 characters)
- Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
- Use environment-specific configurations

### Deployment Security
- Set proper file permissions (755 for CGI scripts)
- Use HTTPS in production
- Configure proper CORS origins
- Enable rate limiting
- Monitor access logs for suspicious activity

### Database Security
- Use dedicated database users with minimal required permissions
- Enable database encryption at rest
- Regular security updates
- Backup encryption

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as soon as possible after validation
- Documented in release notes with severity levels
- Communicated through repository notifications

## Compliance

This API is designed to help maintain compliance with:
- General data protection principles
- Secure coding practices
- Industry standard authentication methods
